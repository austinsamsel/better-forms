# forms challenge

I started with this boilerplate I forked a while ago that I tend to use for small, static websites... it has gulp and npm to make things easier.

You can check out the git log to see what I did at each step. To run it, clone it, then:
```
npm install

gulp
```
It lives at localhost:3000

You can find a few demo tests at localhost:3000/test/
